## Description

A conversion application including Metric/US Imperial conversions of weight, temperature, speed, length, volume, and distance. <br>

While my girlfriend (a German citizen) and I were getting ready to board a plane back to Washington State together, she mentioned she will have a hard time remembering all of the conversions. Quickly (while I still had internet), I made a note of all the possible conversions that would be helpful to her. Upon our 10 hour flight from Germany to Washington State, I wrote all of the code for the conversions on my Linux laptop. I had a fully functioning console application for her use, but decided to spend some extra time with it by designing a user friendly GUI with Windows Forms on my desktop. After browsing some tutorials for a more up-to-date aesthetic, I found one I was happy with for the initial layout, and then I edited it as I saw fit and integrated my conversion code.

### Additional Information
* Made with: Windows Forms App (.NET 5.0)
